<h2>REGISTRATION</h2>


<dl>
<dt>We've sent in my daughter's registration form. How do we know if she got in?</dt>
<dd>Our motto is: "No News Is Good News!" If you do not hear from us, you can assume that your daughter got in. We only contact those who we've had to place on a waiting list.</dd>

<dt>My daughter is on the waiting list; what are her chances of getting in?</dt>
<dd>Your chances may be quite good, depending on where you are on the waiting list. Each year, we have to reserve a block of camper spots for potential staff kids, as staff kids are guaranteed placement in camp. However, we can only estimate how many spots we will need, and we tend to be careful to reserve plenty of spots. As we get commitments from our volunteers and get closer to being fully staffed, we can start opening up some of those reserved spots to the waiting list. As a result, usually at least the first few girls on the waiting list get in - sometimes more.</dd>

<dt>My daughter is eighth on the waiting list - is it hopeless?</dt>
<dd>No, its not hopeless. Often, when we start contacting girls on the waiting list, we find that some of them have made other plans. Also, we occasionally have cancellations. Lastly, if we get enough volunteer staff, we can sometimes open up a whole new unit! So many times, if you can hang in there, we can get her in, even if she is far down on the waiting list.</dd>

<dt>So you're saying that my daughter can get in for sure if her parent/grandparent/aunt/adult sister volunteers to be a counselor at camp?</dt>
<dd>Yup! Until we are fully staffed, staff-kids are guaranteed a spot at camp. Check out the "Adult Volunteers" section of this website for more information.</dd>

<dt>Why do you fill up so fast?</dt>
<dd>Because camp is the BEST experience for girls, of course! Also, many of our returning campers KNOW that they need to get their registration forms in right away, AND because we have to reserve about 40% of our camper spots for potential staff kids in order to guarantee their placement. That does make it tough for new campers to get in. We know that and do everything we can to get the word out to send in those forms right away!</dd>


</dl>



<h2>HEALTH FORMS</h2>


<dl>
<dt>Can we just write "Up-To-Date" in the immunization section of the form?</dt>
<dd>No, please provide actual dates in this section. On a trip to an emergency room, the doctor always wants this information. If you write "current" or "up-to-date", we will have to contact you to get the dates.</dd>

<dt>When are the health forms due?</dt>
<dd>June 1<sup>st</sup>. It is extremely important that we receive health forms on time. They contain information that is needed for a variety of aspects of camp life: i.e. food allergies for the kitchen, medication information for the nurses, and heights and weights for units that use wetsuits. It creates problems for our planning process when forms are received late.</dd>

</dl>

<h2>MAIL</h2>

<dl>

<dt>Do I really have to write to my daughter at camp?</dt>
<dd>YES, YES, YES! Mail is SO important to campers. Being one of the few who doesn't get mail is SO disappointing for your daughter. It is heartbreaking when that happens. Our counselors keep very close watch on this, and if a camper doesn't get mail for a few days, they will write to your daughter. But it's a poor substitute for a letter from YOU!!! Try to write enough letters or postcards so that she gets something every day! And by the way, you WILL get mail from her!<br>
<br>
And at the other end of the spectrum . . .</dd>

<dt>Can I send her a care package? My family wants to FLOOD her with mail - is that okay?</dt>
<dd>Yes, you can send her a care package, but no food or snacks please. Our campers get PLENTY of food at camp, including snacks and desserts. Critters and storage and enough-for-everyone issues make food care packages a real problem. What can you send? Comic books, coloring books, puzzle books or small toys are all welcome treats.<br>
<br>

As far as flooding her with mail . . . while that would be great for your daughter, please remember that some girls will get little to no mail, so a little sensitivity can go a long way. Maybe you can consolidate your letters into fewer envelopes.</dd>

<dt>I know I'm going to miss my daughter SO MUCH! Is it okay if I tell her so when I write to her?</dt>
<dd>Be careful about what you write in your letters. Saying "I miss you a lot, I'm counting the days until you're home," could induce homesickness. It is much better to say, "I love you and I'm so excited for you," while saying, "I know you are having lots of fun hiking, singing, going to the beach and doing crafts. Please tell me everything your unit is doing!" Focus your camper's attention on camp and the fun she is having, not on home. And definitely do NOT share bad news in a letter from home. The bad news can wait for a time when you'll be available to comfort and support her. </dd>

<dt>What's the mailing address?</dt>
<dd>The mailing address is: "Camper Name and unit" Camp Butano Creek P.O. Box 459 Pescadero, CA 94060<br>
<br>
Mail is a little slow to reach us, so please allow several extra days mailing time. Start writing and mailing before she leaves for camp. You can even send all of your letters early and mark the outside of the envelopes: Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, etc.<br>
<br>
Please do NOT send your camper's mail to our Dublin office address - it will NOT reach her there!</dd>

</dl>


<h2>WHAT TO BRING</h2>

<dl>

<dt>Do I really have to label EVERYTHING she brings to camp?</dt>
<dd>Yes, especially if you would like it to come home with her! Group living can be a bit chaotic - labeled clothing and personal belongings help a LOT! Each year we bring home a LOT of Lost and Found - much of which eventually gets donated to Goodwill. Please, please, please label EVERYTHING!</dd>

<dt>The packing list says to bring a white t-shirt or pillowcase to "silkscreen." What is this?</dt>
<dd>Every camper will have the opportunity to have the latest custom-designed silkscreen pattern printed onto a t-shirt or pillowcase. White, or a light-color, is best to use for this purpose.</dd>

<dt>My daughter is always hungry; can I send some snacks or treats with her?</dt>
<dd>Our campers get PLENTY of food at camp, including snacks and desserts. Critters and storage and enough-for-everyone issues make food care packages a real problem. If there is food in your daughter's luggage or sleeping bag, a critter will do whatever is necessary to get to it, so food in unit buildings or tents is strictly forbidden. If you do have concerns about your camper eating frequently, please indicate this on her health form and we will make arrangements for her counselors to have extra snacks available.</dd>

<dt>Does my daughter need to bring a tent or mattress?</dt>
<dd>No, both of these items are provided by the camp.</dd>

<dt>Will my daughter need any money at camp?</dt>
<dd>No, there is nothing to buy at camp. Even the campers who go to the Boardwalk don't need money --- everything that they need is provided. Please do NOT send money with your camper.</dd>

<dt>Can she bring her cell phone?</dt>
<dd>Electronics and cell phones (which don't work there anyway) are on the Do-Not-Bring list. This is camp - it's all about making friends, singing, having fun, and being silly. Children can and do thrive without all things electronic!</dd>

<h2>CAMP LIFE</h2>

<dl>

<dt>Where will my daughter be sleeping?</dt>
<dd>Beachcombers and Drifters sleep in buildings, with campers all on one main floor and counselors in a loft above them. All other units sleep in tents, usually on a platform, with counselors nearby (within earshot) in their own tents. No camper ever sleeps alone.</dd>

<dt>How is the food?</dt>
<dd>Delicious! Nutritious! And plentiful!</dd>

<dt>My daughter is a picky eater/has food allergies/is a vegetarian - how do you handle that?</dt>
<dd>We handle that by providing a fuller menu than you probably do at home. Seconds are almost always available. Even the pickiest eaters usually find something they like and on which they can fill up. Our counselors watch carefully to be sure campers are eating well. Vegetarian options are provided to campers who indicate this dietary requirement on their health form. Our cooks are hyper-vigilant about monitoring food allergies, either by not serving the foods at all, or by ensuring that the allergic campers do not come in contact with the food. For example, peanut butter and jelly are a must-have option for lunch at camp, but they are kept on a separate table from the rest of the lunch-making ingredients in order to prevent contact with the campers with peanut allergies.</dd>

<dt>Will my daughter get bored at camp?</dt>
<dd>Your daughter will do many, many things at camp, but getting bored is NOT one of them! In fact, she will probably come home noticeably excited and tired. We do not recommend planning that round-the-world trip the day after she gets home. She may need to do a bit of catch-up sleeping.</dd>

<dt>What does a typical day at camp look like?</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
	<li>7:00 a.m.Wake up, get dressed</li>
	<li>7:50 a.m.Go to flag-raising ceremony</li>

</ul>
</dd>

<dt>What if my daughter gets sick or is injured?</dt>
<dd>We have a well stocked health center and two camp nurses or specially trained health supervisors. Additionally, the Pescadero Fire Department has an emergency response team just minutes away, and the urgent care center is just north of Half Moon Bay. In the event of an emergency, parents are notified right away. Many of our camp staff have first aid and/or CPR training. Your daughter is in good hands at camp.</dd>

<dt>My daughter's friend backed out and she is coming to camp alone - she won't know anyone else there. She's nervous about that, and frankly, so am I.</dt>
<dd>It's always reassuring to have a buddy coming with you to camp - it does help ease some of the anticipatory nervousness. But frankly, we've been told over and over by the campers themselves, that they actually have MORE fun when they come alone and make new friends. There are ALWAYS lots of girls in each unit who do not know anyone else, and they are ALL very anxious to make new friends too! Our own daughters have done it both ways, and they actually prefer the "new-friends" experience!</dd>

<dt>My daughter and I want to see the camp in advance. When can we do this?</dt>
<dd>That's a great idea --- come to our Open House on Saturday, June 22<sup>nd</sup> from 1:00 - 2:30 p.m.! You'll get a tour of camp and best of all, our staff will be there for our training weekend. You'll be able to meet and talk with them during that time. </dd>

<dt>We can't make it to the Open House - can't I just tour camp when we drop her off?</dt>
<dd>We will be busy transitioning our campers into camp life and just don't have the resources to give you a tour at that time. Also, it is best for your camper if your drop-off is a quick process. However, your daughter MAY give you a tour of camp on pick-up day, if you so choose. By then, she'll know all the ropes and will happily share her camp memories as you walk around camp.</dd>

<dt>May we visit our daughter during the camp session?</dt>
<dd>Many years of camp experience has shown that having parents visit at camp can be very disruptive for campers and staff, so we ask that you only visit during the Open House or on pick-up day. An emergency contact number will be provided in the event you need to contact your daughter for any reason.</dd>

<dt>I have other questions - who can I contact?</dt>
<dd>You can call Laurie Herbert/Clover at (925) 216-4146 or email: <a href="mailto:tsclover@aol.com">tsclover@aol.com</a></dd>
