<dt>I'm an adult interested in staffing!</dt> <dd>We <em>are</em> looking for exceptional, fun-loving adults to staff our camp.  To become a Butano Creek counselor/staffperson you must be at least 18 years old, and like children and the out-of-doors.  We will train you and provide all the information you need to become an effective camp counselor.<br>
<br>
Children of staff receive a $50 discount on their campers' fees.<br>
<br>
Additionally, a tag unit is available for a reduced fee of $205 for non-camper-aged children of staff, including boys age 5 to 12 and girls from age 5 through entering 3rd grade.<br>
<br>
Mandatory Training:  New Staff Orientation is May 18 in Pleasanton; Weekend Training is June 20 - 22, 2014 at Camp Butano. Also, staff and their children arrive at camp two days early<br>
